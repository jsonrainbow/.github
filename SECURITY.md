# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The JSON Rainbow team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by:

1. **Do NOT** open a public issue
2. Send details to the repository maintainers through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. Include as much information as possible:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- We will provide an initial assessment within 7 days
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We will keep you informed about our progress
- Once the vulnerability is fixed, we will publicly acknowledge your contribution (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Scope

This security policy applies to all repositories under the JSON Rainbow organization.

## Supported Versions

Please refer to each individual repository for information about which versions are currently being supported with security updates.

## Security Best Practices
